# Spec 3 Roadmap

Spec 3 resumes RADJAX-Tome planning after the 2.14-2.18 cleanup arc. These
are roadmap arcs, not necessarily single-shot implementation specs.

## Arcs

| Arc | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3.0 | Optimization Handoff Inventory and Roadmap Lock | complete when this document and inventory land |
| 3.1 | Cover Page v1 for unpacked Tome directory | complete once cover-page generation and validation land |
| 3.2 | Tome Bundle Container v1 | planned |
| 3.3 | Teacher Backend Runtime Modes: CPU, CPU+GPU, CPU+TPU | planned |
| 3.4 | Dynamic Top-K Compression Policy | planned |
| 3.5 | Final CLI Polish / Optional TUI | planned |

## Recommended Ordering

1. Bookmark optimization handoff.
2. Implement cover page for unpacked Tome.
3. Implement bundle container.
4. Implement backend runtime modes.
5. Implement dynamic top-k.
6. Polish CLI / optional TUI.

## Ordering Rationale

Cover page defines the artifact contract before optimized generator machinery
targets it. Backend runtime abstraction should exist before porting
CUDA-specific optimizations. Dynamic top-k should wait until artifact metadata
and backend reduction policy surfaces exist. TUI is optional polish after
functional readiness.

Spec 3.1 adds `cover_page.json` for unpacked Tome directories so optimized
generation can target a contract-shaped artifact instead of forcing the contract
to follow an optimization-specific layout later.
